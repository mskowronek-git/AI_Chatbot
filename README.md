This project develops an advanced AI chatbot using the renowned transformer-based architecture, DialoGPT, created by Microsoft. According to human evaluation outcomes, the responses generated by DialoGPT are on par with human-level quality when assessed through a single-turn conversation in a Turing test. The model has been trained on a vast dataset of 147 million multi-turn dialogues, sourced from Reddit discussion threads.
